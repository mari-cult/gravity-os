# To Do

- [x] VirtIO Block Driver
- [x] HFS+ driver
- [ ] Mach IPC
- [ ] Dyld in Rust with demo program
- Implement missing syscalls
- [ ] Add zswap/zram/zsmalloc-like allocator with swap space on disk, use zstd compression, which probably involves switching to an embedded cross target for the C code.
- [ ] APFS Driver (Look into upstreaming https://github.com/indygreg/apple-platform-rs/tree/apfs-next)
